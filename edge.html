     <p><B>MICROSOFT Edge </B>(or simply Edge) is a proprietary cross-platform web browser created by Microsoft. Released in 2015 as part of Windows 10 and Xbox One, it was initially built with Microsoft's own proprietary browser engine, EdgeHTML, and their Chakra JavaScript engine.[7] Later on, it was ported to Android and iOS[8][9] as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source project. In late 2018, Microsoft announced it would completely rebuild Edge as a Chromium-based[10][11] browser with Blink and V8 engines, which allowed the browser to be ported to macOS. The new Edge was publicly released in January 2020,[12][13] and on Xbox platforms in 2021.[14][15] Microsoft has since terminated security support for the original browser (now referred to as Microsoft Edge Legacy).[16] Edge is also available on older Windows versions (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later were supported until early 2023),[17][18] as well as Linux.[19][20]

      Although it was created as the successor to Internet Explorer (IE), Internet Explorer 11 remained available alongside Edge on Windows 10 for compatibility until 2023, when it was removed.[21] In Windows 11, Edge is the default web browser, as well as the only browser available from Microsoft (for compatibility[22][23] with Google Chrome).[24] However, it includes an "Internet Explorer mode," aimed at fixing compatibility issues; it provides the legacy MSHTML browser engine and supports the legacy ActiveX and BHO technologies.[25]
      
      In May 2022, according to StatCounter, Microsoft Edge became the second most popular browser in the world, overtaking Apple Safari. In some countries, such as the United States, Edge is the 3rd most popular, where it has a 14% share, slightly behind Safari's 16% share. As of September 2022, Edge is used by 11% of PCs worldwide.[26]
      <br><br>
      Features
      Microsoft Edge is the default web browser on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows 11, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, replacing Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Explorer Mobile.[27] As its development and release is dependent on the model of Windows as a service, it is not included in Windows 10 Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds.[28][29][30]
      
      Microsoft initially announced that Edge would support the legacy MSHTML (Trident) browser engine for backward compatibility, but later said that, due to "strong feedback", Edge would use a new engine, while Internet Explorer would continue to provide the legacy engine.[31] The developer toolset of the EdgeHTML-based versions featured an option to emulate the rendering behaviour ("document mode") of Internet Explorer versions 5 to 11.[32][33]
      
      Favorites, reading list, browsing history and downloads are viewed at the Hub,[34] a sidebar providing functionality similar to Internet Explorer's Downloads manager and Favorites Center.[35]
      
      Edge features a built-in PDF reader,[36] and supports WebAssembly. Until January 2021, Edge also featured an integrated Adobe Flash Player (with an internal whitelist allowing Flash applets on Facebook websites to load automatically, bypassing all other security controls requiring user activation).[37]
      
      Edge does not support legacy technologies such as ActiveX and Browser Helper Objects, instead it uses an extension system.[5][38][39]
      
      Internet Explorer 11 remained available alongside Edge on Windows 10 for compatibility until 2023, when it was removed.[21] It remained identical to the Windows 8.1 version and did not use the Edge engine as was previously announced.[5][27][38] In Windows 11, Edge became the only browser available from Microsoft. However, it includes an "Internet Explorer mode", aimed at fixing compatibility issues; it provides the legacy MSHTML browser engine and supports the legacy ActiveX and BHO technologies.[25]
      <br><br>
      Edge integrates with Microsoft's online platforms to provide voice control, search functionality, and dynamic information related to searches within the address bar. Users can make annotations to web pages that can be stored to and shared with OneDrive,[40] and can save HTML and MHTML pages to their computers. It also integrates with the "Reading List" function and provides a "Reading Mode" that strips unnecessary formatting from pages to improve their legibility.[40] Edge also has a new feature called vertical tabs which allow users to move tabs on the left side of the screen.[41]
      
      Preliminary support for browser extensions was added in March 2016, with build 14291, three extensions were initially supported. Microsoft indicated that the delay in allowing extensions and the small number was due to security concerns.[42] As of December 2022, there are more than 9,000 extensions—called add-ons—available for Edge.[43]
      
      On February 7, 2023, Microsoft announced a major overhaul to Edge, revamping the user interface with Fluent Design, along with adding a Bing Chat (later known as Microsoft Copilot) button, which replaces the Discover button.[44]
      
      Release strategy
      Microsoft Edge Legacy's release cadence was tied to the Windows 10 release cycle and used the Windows Insider Program to preview new versions of the browser. These pre-release builds were known as "Edge Preview". Every major release of Windows included an updated version of Edge and its render engine.
      
      On April 8, 2019, Microsoft announced the introduction of four preview channels: Canary, Dev, Beta, and Stable and launched the Canary and Dev channels that same day with the first preview builds, for those channels, of the new Edge. Microsoft collectively calls the Canary, Dev, and Beta channels the "Microsoft Edge insider channels".[45] As a result, Edge updates were decoupled from new versions of Windows. Major versions of Edge Stable are now scheduled for release every 4 weeks, closely following Chromium version releases.
      
      Surf (video game)
      Main article: Surf (video game)
      In May 2020, an update to Microsoft Edge added Surf, a browser game where players control a surfer attempting to evade obstacles and collect powerups. Similar to Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game, Surf is accessible from the browser's offline error page and can also be accessed by entering edge://surf into the address bar. The game features three game modes (classic, time trial, and slalom), has character customization, and supports keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad controls.[46][47] Its gameplay has been compared to the 1991 Microsoft video game SkiFree.[48][49]
      <br><br>
      In 2021, Surf was updated with limited-time seasonal theming resembling SkiFree. Instead of surfing, the player skis down a mountain while being chased by a yeti.[50]

      In December 2014, writing for ZDNet, technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft was developing a new web browser codenamed "Spartan" for Windows 10. She said that "Spartan" would be treated as a new product separate from Internet Explorer, with Internet Explorer 11 retained alongside it for compatibility.[51]
      
      In early January 2015, The Verge obtained further details surrounding "Spartan" from sources close to Microsoft, including reports that it would replace Internet Explorer on both the desktop and mobile versions of Windows 10.[52] Microsoft officially unveiled "Spartan" during a Windows 10-focused keynote on January 21, 2015.[40] It was described as a separate product from Internet Explorer, its final name was not announced.[53]
      
      "Spartan" was first made publicly available as the default browser of Windows 10 Technical Preview build 10049, released on March 30, 2015.[54] The new engine used by "Spartan" was available in Windows 10 builds as part of Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft later announced that Internet Explorer would be deprecated on Windows 10 and would not use the "Spartan" engine.[27][55]
      
      On April 29, 2015, during the Build Conference keynote, it was announced that "Spartan" would officially be known as Microsoft Edge.[56] The browser's logo and branding were designed to maintain continuity with the branding of Internet Explorer.[57] The Project "Spartan" branding was used in versions released after Build 2015. On June 25, 2015, Microsoft released version 19.10149 for Windows 10 Mobile which included the new brand. On June 28, 2015, version 20.10158 followed for the desktop versions, also including the updated branding. On July 15, 2015, Microsoft released version 20.10240 as the final release to Insiders. The same version was rolled out to consumers on July 29, 2015.
      
      On August 12, 2015, Microsoft started the preview program for the next version of Microsoft Edge. They released version 20.10512 to Mobile users. 6 days later followed by version 20.10525 for desktop users. The preview received multiple updates. On November 5, 2015, Microsoft released version 25.10586 as the final release for Edge's second public release for desktop users. On November 12, 2015, the update was rolled out to both desktop users and Xbox One users as part of the New Xbox Experience Update. On November 18, 2015, the update was to Windows 10 Mobile. Finally, on November 19, 2015, the update was also made available as part of the Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4.[58]</p>
